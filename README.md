### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm install
```

```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.




### Translation (i18n) setup

For translation, the project uses `next-intl` . You can collaborate with your translation team or translate the messages yourself with the help of machine translation.

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by making a search in the whole project with `FIXME:` for making quick customization. Here is some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/BaseTemplate.tsx`: default theme
- `next-sitemap.config.js`: sitemap configuration
- `.env`: default environment variables

You have access to the whole code source if you need further customization. The provided code is only example for you to start your project. The sky is the limit 🚀.

### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
npm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Testing

All unit tests are located with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing. You can run the tests with:

```shell
npm run test
```

### Integration & E2E Testing

The project uses Playwright for Integration and E2E testing. You can run the tests with:

```shell
npx playwright install # Only for the first time in a new environment
npm run test:e2e
```

### Enable Edge runtime (optional)

The App Router folder is compatible with the Edge runtime. You can enable it by uncommenting the following lines `src/app/layouts.tsx`:

```tsx
// export const runtime = 'edge';
```



### Deploy to production



Then, you can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

It generates an optimized production build of the boilerplate. For testing the generated build, you can run:

```shell
$ npm run start
```


The command starts a local server with the production build. Then, you can now open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see the project.



### Code coverage

NextJS Boilerplate relies on [Codecov](https://codecov.io) for code coverage reporting solution. To use Codecov, create a Codecov account and connect it to your GitHub account. On your Codecov dashboard, it should display a list of your repositories. Select the repository you want to enable Codecov for and copy the token. Then, in your GitHub Actions, you need to define the `CODECOV_TOKEN` environment variable and paste the token you copied.

Be sure to create the `CODECOV_TOKEN` as a Github Actions secret, do not paste it directly into your source code.



### Useful commands

#### Bundle Analyzer

NextJS Boilerplate comes with a built-in bundle analyzer. It can be used to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles. To begin, run the following command:

```shell
npm run build-stats
```

By running the command, it'll automatically open a new browser window with the results.


### Known warnings

#### webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy

Warning: webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy Serializing big strings (104kiB) impacts deserialization performance (consider using Buffer instead and decode when needed)


### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
